# programblog4


finally, i am learning....... and why I am sying that because when I go through with any documentation related to 
any library I can understand and I can apply those terms to my code before this I was not able to do that 

this particular blog is all about using MYO with web browser but unfortunately I am still learning and making mistakes so I could not achieve what I want but I am almost near so if you will go through with these files you will be able to use myo with your terminal through OSC.js and Node.js I am still trying to figure it out where I am wrong and hopefully in my next blog will be success full.



right now in this file its a simple function arm In and arm OUT so when ever you will do some action you can see those text over the terminal. 


try this and let me know if this works with your MYO
